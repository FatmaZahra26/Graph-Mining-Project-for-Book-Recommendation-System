# Graph Mining Project for Book Recommendation System 📚📊🔎📖

I used networkx and GNN 🤖🔗 to develop this project. The goal was to create a book recommendation system based on graph mining techniques. This involved analyzing a large dataset of books and users, and using networkx to construct a graph of book-user interactions.

Using graph neural networks (GNN), I was able to make personalized book recommendations based on the user's reading history and preferences. The system was evaluated using a variety of metrics to measure its effectiveness in recommending books that the user would enjoy.

Overall, this project was a fascinating exploration of the intersection between graph mining and book recommendations 🤓📚.
